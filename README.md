-Hi, I´m Tobias Pucci Romero, an industrial engineer andvanced student increasingly interested in Data Science and Machine Learning fields. 
I have solid experience in Python, and an overall good undertanding in R and SQL.

I also have a hard statistical background, with emphasis on process/product improvement
and Business requirements.

-I´ve done projects such as:
- Machine KPI´s clustering with log data (to detect similar failure cases)
- Seamless tubes (OCTG) demand forecast with XGBOOST 
- Seamless tubes Time series analysis and Forecast with ARIMA
- Novelty detection (One Class SVM) on data entry 

Due to data privacy (and company politics), i´m not allowed to disclose those project.
